# Transportation
A simulation of a transportation system (Kim Ma - Nguyen Thai Hoc) in Hanoi, Vietnam
This is code of 'Integrating Multi-agent System, Geographic Information System, and Reinforcement Learning to Simulate and Optimize Traffic Signal Control' in IC2IT2018
This model only contains the actual system simulation, the part of integrating MAS with RL is not here!
